## Deskripsi dan Latar Belakang
Version 2 of Mikiflix a Free anime streaming site where you can watch your favourite anime online powered by Sveltekit

The Mikiflix project initially used React for its first version. However, its performance was suboptimal, and the use of Chakra UI as the UI library required significant time to learn and implement. These challenges made development and maintenance less efficient.

Therefore, for version 2, Mikiflix was re-engineered using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS. With SvelteKit, the application became lighter and more responsive, while Tailwind CSS allowed for faster and easier styling without the need to learn additional libraries. This approach was taken to enhance performance, simplify maintenance, and provide a better user experience.
